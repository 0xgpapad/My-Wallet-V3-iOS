///// `Wallet.m` needs to be injected into much of the `WalletRepository` type classes.
///// The reason is we still heavily rely on `My-Wallet-V3`. We don't want to bring this into
///// `PlatformKit` as a dependency. So, we have `Wallet.m` conform to protocols that we need
///// and inject it in as a dependency. Frequently we'll use the term `bridge` as a way of
///// describing this.
